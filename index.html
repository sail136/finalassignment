         <h1>Nepal</h1>
      <p>Nepal Himalayas, east-central section and highest part of the Himalayan mountain ranges in south-central Asia, extending some 500 miles (800 km) from the Kali River east to the Tista River.The range occupies most of Nepal and extends into the Tibet Autonomous Region of China and Sikkim state in India. The Nepal-Tibet border roughly follows the line of the highest part of the range (the Great Himalayas), featuring several of the world’s highest peaks: Everest (29,035 feet [8,850 metres]), Kanchenjunga (28,169 feet [8,586 metres]), Makalu (27,766 feet [8,463 metres]), Dhaulagiri I (26,795 feet [8,167 metres]), Manaslu I (26,781 feet [8,163 metres]), and Annapurna I (26,545 feet [8,091 metres]). These permanently snow-covered mountains overlook huge glaciers. Rivers flow southward through deep ravines that cut through even the highest ridges; thus, the watershed between the Brahmaputra (north) and the Ganges (south) lies in Tibet well north of the greatest peaks.<br>The Great Himalayas form a climatic barrier between the monsoonal (wet-dry) Indian lowland plains and the Tibetan desert high plateau. The barren, uninhabitable highlands also are a major impediment to human travel; the turbulent rivers cannot be navigated, and their steep rocky banks make foot traffic difficult. The few passes are at elevations between 16,000 and 19,000 feet (5,000 and 6,000 metres).The near otherworldly Himalayan kingdom of Nepal can trace its history back to the 7th century and the arrival of Kirati sheepherders.

        <h2>Bhutan</h2>
      <p> Bhutan first allowed the world a peek inside in 1974. With four millennia of habitation, the Himalayan kingdom offers a trove of archaeological treasures, including many ornate temples and dzong fortresses.The country is slightly smaller than Switzerland. Much of the terrain is made up of mountainous slopes.<br> Bhutan has a rich and unique cultural heritage that has largely remained intact because of its isolation from the rest of the world until the mid-20th century. One of the main attractions for tourists is the country's culture and traditions. Bhutanese tradition is deeply steeped in its Buddhist heritage. Hinduism is the second most dominant religion in Bhutan, being most prevalent in the southern regions.While Bhutanese citizens are free to travel abroad, Bhutan is viewed as inaccessible by many foreigners. Another reason for it being an unpopular destination is the cost, which is high for tourists on tighter budgets. Entry is free for citizens of India, Bangladesh, and the Maldives, but all other foreigners are required to sign up with a Bhutanese tour operator and pay around US$250 per day that they stay in the country, though this fee covers most travel, lodging and meal expenses.Bhutan received 37,482 visitor arrivals in 2011, of which 25% were for meetings, incentives, conferencing, and exhibitions.Bhutan is the first nation in the world to ban smoking. It has been illegal to smoke in public or sell tobacco, according to Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010. Violators are fined the equivalent of $232—a month's salary in Bhutan.

          <h3>China</h3>
      <p>The Great wall itself was the key part of the defensive system. It usually stood 21.3 feet (6.5 metres) wide at the base and 19 feet (5.8 metres) at the top, with an average height of 23 to 26 feet (7 to 8 metres), or a bit lower on steep hills. The structure of the wall varied from place to place, depending on the availability of building materials. Walls were made of tamped earth sandwiched between wooden boards, adobe bricks, a brick and stone mixture, rocks, or pilings and planks. Some sections made use of existing river dikes; others used rugged mountain terrain such as cliffs and gorges to take the place of man-made structures.<br> In the western deserts the walls were often simple structures of rammed earth and adobe; many eastern ramparts, such as those near Badaling, were faced with stone and included a number of secondary structures and devices. On the inner side of such walls, placed at small intervals, were arched doors called juan, which were made of bricks or stones.Talking about the best cities to visit in China, travelers recommend almost 30 big and small cities. For a visitor on ten to fifteen days package, it is suggested to add only five to six cities at a time. Now it's up to your preferences to select the cities to visit in China. You can divide your tour in a way that among that you can cover up all the fun sides of the country. Add one city which is popular for natural beauty, one for luxurious living standards, one for historic references, and one for shopping and nightlife </p>
